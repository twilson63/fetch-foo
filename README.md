# Fetch Foo

Fetch Foo is a set of exercises focused on getting practice calling restful services using the fetch function. `fetch` is provided in most browsers and with legacy browsers it can be added via a pollyfill.

Some api services that we will be using will require some sort of authentication token in order to access its endpoints.

In the readme and each test page there will be instructions on how to get the authentication code to make api calls to the service.

## Services

Here are the services we will be using:

- dog.ceo
- newsapi.com
- omdbapi.com
- github.com

## Challenges

Each challenge is listed in the source challenges folder, the challenge will be focused on the fetch call, so you don't have to worry how it is getting called or how the response is being rendered, this exercise is just to focus on the fetch method itself.
